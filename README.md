## Description

I enhanced a fully functional application by integrating Cypress for comprehensive component and end-to-end testing. The application, built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API, enables users to participate in a quiz featuring ten random questions and view their final score. Despite successfully completing all required features, I encountered a persistent issue where Cypress crashes when attempting to run either E2E or component spec tests, loading everything up to that point. I invested significant time and effort into debugging this problem, but unfortunately, a solution remained elusive.
